# Dashboard Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring of the dashboard page into smaller, more maintainable components.

## Files Created

### Types (`/types/dashboard.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Centralized type definitions for all dashboard-related interfaces
- **Exports**: `User`, `TradingKey`, `AiKey`, `Position`, `MarketDataKey`, `MarketData`, `NotificationData`, `ComboboxOption`

### Constants (`/constants/dashboard.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Static data and configuration options
- **Exports**: `SYMBOL_OPTIONS`, `REPORT_TYPE_OPTIONS`, `MOCK_POSITIONS`, `MOCK_MARKET_DATA_KEYS`

### Hooks

#### `useDashboardData` (`/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Manages all data fetching and state for dashboard entities
- **Returns**: User data, trading keys, AI keys, positions, market data keys, and notification management
- **Features**: Automatic data fetching on mount, error handling, mock data fallbacks

#### `useAiReport` (`/hooks/useAiReport.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Handles AI report generation logic
- **Returns**: Report state, generation function, and UI controls
- **Features**: Form validation, API communication, success/error handling

### Components (`/components/dashboard/`)

#### `MarketAnalysis`

- **Purpose**: Market data selection and TradingView chart display
- **Props**: Market data state, market data keys, and event handlers
- **Features**: API provider selection, currency pair selection, chart integration

#### `AiReportGenerator`

- **Purpose**: AI report generation form and controls
- **Props**: Trading keys, AI keys, form state, and generation handler
- **Features**: Dropdown selections, validation, progress indication

#### `PositionsPanel`

- **Purpose**: Trading positions display and management
- **Props**: Positions array and notification handler
- **Features**: Position cards with P&L display, status indicators

#### `DashboardPanels`

- **Purpose**: Layout wrapper for resizable AI report and positions panels
- **Props**: All data and handlers needed by child components
- **Features**: Resizable layout, prop delegation

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- Logic is separated from UI components
- Data fetching is isolated in custom hooks
- Types and constants are centralized

### 2. **Reusability**

- Components can be reused in other parts of the application
- Hooks can be shared across different pages
- Types ensure consistency across the codebase

### 3. **Maintainability**

- Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Easier testing and debugging

### 4. **Scalability**

- New features can be added without modifying existing code
- Easy to add new market data providers or AI services
- Component composition allows for flexible layouts

## File Structure

```
/types/
  dashboard.ts                 # Type definitions
/constants/
  dashboard.ts                 # Static data and options
/hooks/
  useDashboardData.ts         # Data fetching logic
  useAiReport.ts              # AI report logic
  index.ts                    # Hook exports
/components/dashboard/
  market-analysis.tsx         # Market selection & chart
  ai-report-generator.tsx     # Report generation form
  positions-panel.tsx         # Positions display
  dashboard-panels.tsx        # Layout wrapper
  index.ts                    # Component exports
/app/dashboard/
  page.tsx                    # Main dashboard page (simplified)
```

## Migration Notes

The original `page.tsx` file was approximately 620 lines and has been reduced to about 80 lines by extracting:

- ~50 lines of type definitions → `/types/dashboard.ts`
- ~40 lines of constants → `/constants/dashboard.ts`
- ~100 lines of data fetching logic → `/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`
- ~80 lines of AI report logic → `/hooks/useAiReport.ts`
- ~150 lines of market analysis UI → `/components/dashboard/market-analysis.tsx`
- ~120 lines of AI report UI → `/components/dashboard/ai-report-generator.tsx`
- ~90 lines of positions UI → `/components/dashboard/positions-panel.tsx`

This refactoring maintains the exact same functionality while improving code organization and maintainability.
